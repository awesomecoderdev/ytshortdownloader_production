                        opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded
                        invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The use of
                        a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains
                        the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such
                        as the path of pages visited at a website. SaveFrom uses the information provided by web beacons to
